## Requirements

    Operating system: tested on Ubuntu 16.04LTS
    R: tested on R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15) -- "Someone to Lean On"
    RAM requirements: Especially for data preprocessing, do not attempt to run without at least 50 GB of RAM.


## Structure

Under the folder /Scripts/ you may find all  R-scripts employed in the data analysis of our Genome Biology paper. These are separated into the 7 sections, corresponding to those of the paper:

  1) *Data preparation*: all scripts employed in the preprocessing of 450K data whose raw IDAT data were available: E-risk (GSE105018), Danish Twin Cohort (GSE61496), TwinsUK, NSPHS (GSE87571), Chinese Children (GSE104812), ENID-Gambia (GSE99863) and Longitudinal adipose tissue (GSE103768).
  
  2) *evCpG discovery*: all scripts employed in the identification of evCpGs in the E-risk cohort.
  
  3) *evCpG annotation*: all scripts employed in the functional annotation of evCpGs.
  
  4) *evCpG technical and longitudinal variation assessment*: all scripts employed in the assessment of technical and longitudinal stability of evCpGs.
  
  5) *evCpGs' relationship with aging*: all scripts employed in the assessment of the effects of aging on evCpGs.
  
  6) *evCpGs' variation across tissues*: all scripts employed in the exploration of evCpGs' behaviour in post-mortem tissues, the replication of evCpGs and there longitudinal stability in adipose tissue.
  
  7) *evCpGs validation across technologies*: all scripts employed in the validation of evCpGs in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data of monozygotic twins in blood and in adipose tissue.
